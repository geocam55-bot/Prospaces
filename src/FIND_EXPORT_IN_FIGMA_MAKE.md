# 🔍 How to Export Your Project from Figma Make

## Can't Find the Export Button? Try These Steps

---

## Option 1: Look for the Menu Icon

### Check the Top-Right Corner

Look for one of these icons:

1. **Three dots** (⋮ or ⋯)
2. **Hamburger menu** (☰ three lines)
3. **Gear icon** (⚙️ settings)
4. **Share button** 
5. **Download icon** (⬇️)

Click it and look for:
- "Export"
- "Download"
- "Download Project"
- "Export Project"
- "Download as ZIP"

---

## Option 2: Check the Top Menu Bar

Look at the very top of the Figma Make interface for:

- **File** menu → Look for "Export" or "Download"
- **Project** menu → "Download Project"
- **Share** menu → "Export Project"

---

## Option 3: Try Keyboard Shortcuts

Sometimes there are hidden keyboard shortcuts:

- **Ctrl+E** (Windows) or **Cmd+E** (Mac) - for Export
- **Ctrl+S** (Windows) or **Cmd+S** (Mac) - for Save/Download

---

## Option 4: Look in the Project Name Area

Click on your project name at the top - sometimes this opens a dropdown with export options.

---

## Option 5: Right-Click Method

Try right-clicking (or Ctrl+Click on Mac) in different areas:
- On your project name
- In the file explorer/list
- On the canvas area

Look for "Export" or "Download" in the context menu.

## 🚨 Still Can't Find It?

### Alternative Method: Use Browser Developer Tools

If Figma Make doesn't have an obvious export button, you can download files directly:

#### Step 1: Open Developer Tools
- **Chrome/Edge:** Press **F12** or **Ctrl+Shift+I** (Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
- **Firefox:** Press **F12** or **Ctrl+Shift+I** (Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
- **Safari:** Enable Developer menu first, then Cmd+Option+I

#### Step 2: Go to Sources Tab
1. Click **"Sources"** tab in Developer Tools (top of the panel)
2. Look for your files in the left panel
3. You should see your `.tsx`, `.ts`, `.json` files

#### Step 3: Download Each File
1. Click on a file (e.g., `App.tsx`)
2. Right-click in the code area
3. Choose **"Save as..."** or **"Copy"** 
4. Save to your computer

**Note:** This is tedious for many files, but works as a last resort.

## 🎯 Better Alternative: Use GitHub Directly

If export doesn't work, you can push your code to GitHub directly from Figma Make:

### Check for GitHub Integration

Look for:
- **GitHub icon** in the toolbar
- **"Push to GitHub"** button
- **"Connect to GitHub"** option
- **"Version Control"** or **"Git"** menu

If you find this:
1. Click it
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Create new repository
4. Push your code directly

**This skips the download step entirely!** ✨
